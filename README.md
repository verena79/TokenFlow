# TokenFlow

<h3>Description:</h3>

In order to better understand the flow of BPMN processes it can often be helpful to simulate the modeled 
process. For this purpose, a token can be used which runs through the process on different possible paths 
and thus creates different scenarios. The concept of tokens flowing through a process model is very useful 
to understand the meaning and execution  of a BPMN model. Drop your own model in the visualize tap and start
your token simulation.
